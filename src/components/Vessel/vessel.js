                        Our new boat is a 35' custom Donelle. She has a 350 HP Cummins diesel engine. Her design allows for more than enough fishing room for everyone on board as she has a 14 ft beam and a large deck space. The vessel has a spacious, fully enclosed cabin that can keep you warm and dry in between fishing spots.

                    <li>
                        The Nearfall is equipped with the top-of-the-line electronics to make sailing safe, efficient and precise. She comes with dual fish finders, networked with GPS and Radar, 2 VHF radios, Sirius Weather and the latest USCG safety equipment. We have self-inflating life jackets, EPIRBs, and a liferaft. Your safety is our number one priority when sailing with the Nearfall team.

                        The vesselâ€™s cabin has a comfortable dinette area, refrigerator, microwave and coffee station as well as large forward bunks.

                        The Nearfall team spares no expense with our fishing gear. All of our rods are custom-built and are brand new in 2022. We have both conventional and spinning rod setups available depending on your preference and the type of fish we are targeting.
